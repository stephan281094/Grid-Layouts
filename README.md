# Grid-Layouts

Experimenting with CSS Grid Layouts. Inspired by
[this article](https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/css-grid-layout-6c9cba6e8a5a)

## What
This repository has been created to experiment with the new
[CSS spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid-1/) that might change CSS grid
layouts dramatically in the near future. Read the
[article](https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/css-grid-layout-6c9cba6e8a5a) for
more information.

## How
Browsers are still busy implementing this spec. Right now only Chrome has
implemented the specification far enough to play with grids. To enable it in
Chrome you must enable the flag by going to
`chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` and clicking
`enable`.

At the moment it's not really possible to use Grid Layouts in other browsers,
unless you use a [polyfill](https://github.com/FremyCompany/css-grid-polyfill).

## Installation
[Meteor](http://meteor.com) is used to allow for faster developing. In order to
run this website locally you need to do the following steps:

1. [Install meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) if you haven't already
2. Run `meteor` when located in this project
3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
